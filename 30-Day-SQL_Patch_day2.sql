— Can you join two tables without common columns in it ?


— My answer/Solution 

Yes, it's possible to join two tables without any common column, but it's generally not recommended as it might result in a Cartesian product, where every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table, resulting in a potentially large and meaningless result set. However, sometimes such joins are necessary depending on the specific requirements of your task.
Here's an example of how you might perform a join without any common column using a cross join:
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;


in this query, every row from table1 will be paired with every row from table2, resulting in a Cartesian product. This can be a very expensive operation, especially if the tables have a large number of rows.
It's important to note that such joins are rarely used in practice and should be approached with caution. It's always preferable to have at least one common column on which to join the tables to ensure meaningful results.
